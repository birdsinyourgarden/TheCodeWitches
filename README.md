# TheCodeWitches

## Description

We are women who call on our best qualities. We add our ingredients: the wisdom of commitment, inclusiveness,
and Agile methodology. All this leads us to turn the language of programming into a social and creative communication at the service of humanity. 

The magic of believing in ourselves, is to know that everything is possible. ðŸ’œ
